        <h2>Collection</h2>
        <p>
          We collect personal data related to your identity and demographics
          when you interact with our Platform, use our food delivery services,
          or engage with us during our relationship. This includes, but is not
          limited to, information provided during sign-up or usage, such as your
          name, date of birth, delivery address, telephone/mobile number, email
          ID, and any proof of identity or address you share. With your consent,
          we may collect sensitive personal data, such as payment information
          (e.g., bank account, credit/debit card details, or UPI IDs) or
          location data to facilitate order delivery and enhance your
          experience, all in compliance with applicable laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we may collect information about your ordering behavior,
          food preferences, device location, browsing history, and other data
          you provide from time to time. Our primary goal is to deliver a safe,
          efficient, seamless, and personalized food delivery experience. This
          enables us to offer services and features tailored to your
          preferences, making your interactions with SoftGrid easier and more
          enjoyable. You can browse parts of our Platform anonymously, but once
          you provide personal data, you are identifiable to us. We indicate
          which fields are required and which are optional, and you may choose
          not to provide certain information by opting out of specific services
          or features.

          apply, and we are not responsible for their practices. We encourage
          you to review their policies before sharing information.
